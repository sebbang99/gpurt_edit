# CWPack / Example

The example contains a program that takes a json file and converts it to a messagePack file, then converts the latter back to json.

In the script runExample.sh the 2 json files are also diffed.

The files `item.*` contains a memory tree representation of json data and the conversion routines:

- Item Tree To Json File
- Item Tree To MessagePack File
- Json File To Item Tree
- MessagePack File To Item Tree

The conversion routines are just examples and not of production quality.
